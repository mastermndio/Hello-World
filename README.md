# Hello World

Your stub code sets up a function called `hello_world`. Your job is to write code that will return the string "Hello World!" exactly as you see it. 

## Hints
- DO NOT CHANGE THE FUNCTION NAME! For the tests to work, it needs to retain the current name
- This will only test the functionality of the `hello_world` function in the javascript file. You can add whatever code you need elsewhere to ensure you are doing the right thing.
- This will be testing the data COMING OUT of the function, NOT data displayed on the screen.
- ignore the other files in this repo. The only file you need to modify is the `hello-world.js"

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo
```bash
git clone 
```

2. Enter Hello-World repo
```bash
cd Hello-World
```

3. Run an NPM install to enable the automatic tests
``` bash
npm install
```

4. Run npm test to execite tests when you think you have solved the issue and are redy to test.

```bash
npm run test
```

5. Commit your answers and push code.
